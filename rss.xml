            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Planning Intelligence Product (2 of 6)</h1>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/932e9e99-3bec-4e27-af38-75e4a5d19a9a.jpg">,<h2>What are you going to learn in this blog</h2>,<p>You're going to learn about what we've used in regard to planning activity and managing the delivery cycle. You're going to see our cycle, and how we managed backlog. And you're going to see that as a function we flex based on need of customer. Customer is, after all… King. You're also going to learn than 6 months after setting up a new team, certain process are still quite fluid and dynamic as we settle into what works for us.</p>,<p>Right, before we start let's recognise that there's a cycle of activity in the planning section. You engage, then capture, record and schedule(=planning=this bit), deliver, review and restart. But the planning side is key, I've seen teams that haven't got a good handle on planning undermine their credibility and really struggle to demonstrate value because they'll start moving into a place where triage is a method of prioritising and that's not a good place to be.</p>]]></description>

The sections as we see them are</p>,<ol><li>Idea Generation</li><li>Planning &amp; Management</li><li>Delivery</li><li>Sign off</li></ol>,<p>And a couple of supporting elements</p>,<ol><li>Engagement</li><li>Strategy</li></ol>,<p>If this is your first read, i’d recommend reading the “about me” section, as it’s useful background.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>So a colleague and I pulled together a powerbi file that leverages the Rosette API - a text analytics service with a free tier pricing model. We use it to analyse groups of text for local government, typically social care outputs and thought it might be useful for others… so feel free to download and use. It’s got an example in there for your viewing pleasure.</p>,<article><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/ffcfc16a817adad73e4278fef27b80e9/noop?input=https%3A%2F%2Favatars2.githubusercontent.com%2Fu%2F23039305%3Fv%3D3%26s%3D400"><h1>PowerPork/PowerBI</h1><p>PowerBI stuff</p></article>]]></description>
