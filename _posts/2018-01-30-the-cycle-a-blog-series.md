# The cycle, a blog series

So for my first blog I thought I'd talk you through our delivery cycle,
with one blog per section, stuff we do as a team and any lessons we've learnt
that we might spare you from being burnt from. The sections as we see them are

1. Idea Generation
2. Planning & Management
3. Delivery
4. Sign off

And a couple of supporting elements

1. Engagement
2. Strategy

Now, onto the first in the series - idea generation

## **What are you going to learn in this blog?**

Techniques and things I've looked out for, my approach in inspiring our customers, and tools we used to do that. Some superlatives, grammar errors and a smidge of excitement. If this is your first read, i'd recommend reading the "about me" section, as it's useful background.

If your organisation is anything like mine, or in the same maturity position as ours, you'll recognise those that have a strong compulsion to be data driven and  those a little more resistant and only engage with data to the degree that have to. There are different
techniques I have used, and obviously the more difficult group to tackle are the detractors. But fear not!!! Despite the fact to start with my only weapon to use in this battle was a flurry of superlatives (which ended up in my team being referred to as "team awesome") I've learnt a little here. What you'll read in this post are techniques and things I've looked out for, my approach in inspiring our customers, and tools we used to do that.

### **To introduce people to what they want, make it easier to access what they need**

Everyone NEEDS to see their performance. Most organisations are somewhere in performance, some review it quarterly some daily... but everyone loves a good benchmark, a slick trend line or some phat traffic lights. They need it because  it's one of the areas their line management demands vertical transparency. A technique I've used in
the past is to pick a particular measure and explode it - organise a session (see innovation hour later in this blog) to kick about how this measure could be best analysed. I'd recommend your thinking to be focussed bias to the end result - we work in a local authority but services are complex, so it's really easy to lose track in the impact to customer, but it's really powerful to drag that back. Often services have no clue about their types of customer, or intelligence about driving demand... so factoring in socio economic data is always a win, or indices of deprivation. Link it back to what drives their
demand or influences their profit

### **Give them something they never asked for**

I pretty much make this a staple for every project. If we as a team of data experts can't think of something that the services didn't specify but would add value then we need to give our heads a shake. If that's a piece of data, or helping them understand their demand seasonality with a suite of visuals it's an important way of making your customer realise that something different can be done with their data. We've recently done this in a social
care service - we are currently revamping all of the data products our adult social care teams can see. I kicked off a piece of work to visualise the referral pathway end to end, which sat across the top of these individual dashboards, and provided a perspective of the customers journey the service from initial contact to service completion that the service had never seen before. They are now able to identify customers that experience a non standard journey, and review those promptly and this knowledge wasn't visible before. Lost.

### **Provide data with operational value, not just analytical value**

I hate hate hate the connotation of dashboards so much that I refer to things we produce as data or intelligence product because it might be a dashboard, but it might be a data driven alert, or a workflow process. But bigger than that, I hate being shoehorned into thinking BI tools provide an interesting view of the past. Data is locked away in systems that can help operational, day to day decisions too, and I think that's the place they need
to be deployed. We're looking at something right now, it's an integrated project, crossing over Master Data Management and some pretty innovative network relationship mapping - which will provide a report driven, google-esque view to our front door. When a child referral presents, this product will allow someone to search quickly and get relevant intelligence back within a few seconds. Family members, extended (data mined, it's super sexy!) network included identified risks, closeness to risks, geographic considerations,
previous contact history and tons of other stuff that's weighted by potential relevance and something that would take 30 minutes easy to gather by navigating the front end systems. THIS is what powerBI is all about. THIS is what you should focus on. THIS is the sort of thing that could maybe even provide the intelligence to improve a child's life.

### **Try to find stuff your customer hasn't realised would be of value**

One of the first wins we had  back in 2014 was with a customer that was sat on ANPR data for all cars that came into household waste recycling centres. So they got data monthly, in excel - one per site, and a row for each entry and exit with car reg, date and time stamps. My developer stumbled across these the business didn't really do anything with them other than use to validate complaints. My word did we have a proper nerd out when we got that in our grubby mits. Within a couple of weeks we'd knocked out customer profiles, identified different types of customers and their usage patterns, we'd tapped up the DfT for vehicle information (make, model, type) so we can understand vehicles that were registered commercial, that were visiting often but we weren't challenging them for fee's... the lot. If I had put that data in the hands of the majority of you, you would have done the same thing and that's what you need to do. The second part is shouting about it.

### **Crow like your competing with Peter Pan**.

When you've done a good-un, you **absolutely **need to shout about it. The customer themselves need to see it, but honestly... crowing to others about the win you've given to them is the ticket to changing their view from detractor to evangelist because the weight of peer pressure is much more persuasive than some nerd, vibrating with excitement and coffee is. Show their management, show your management. Sent a corporate mailshot with a monthly update and get it up on the top. Shout about it on social networks. And play it cool! You need to leave them with the "Yea course it's amazing, another day in the office pssht". At the end of the first year we did a corporate blog - trying to sow the seed of value in advanced analytics, playing the idea that santa claus uses clustering to figure out naughty and nice kids. It had the biggest reception from a blog for 2 years prior and it's record was only broken by another team blog a year later, from someone in my team who went to visit NASA (shoutout Ped!) and then again by someone in my team who went to Tableau-fest in Seattle (shoutout Jonni!).

_You need to remember that idea generation starts within a team of motivated individuals and that may well be only you and your team. We were in a similar place and we used the following as additional idea generation techniques._

### **Innovation Hour**

Is that cheesy? Course it is. Cheesy is fun, fun is light-hearted and being anti-serious is a good lubricant for ideas. To this end we had a weekly meeting where we sat down as a group of excited people, and looked at - to start with - new stuff we'd learnt on powerBI. New DAX formula & patterns, new resources, Chris Webbs new blog posts, new power query processes and new visuals. We'd then chat on about new bits of data we've found in the organisation and try to join the dots between us to create a list of "cool stuff we need to do". We'd meet most weeks and it was literally like working in a start up (id imagine, I live too far up north to have every experienced that) getting excited and trying out new stuff. Your team is likely to be the best incubator of ideas, so milk it regularly and often, and invite others that you share the same passion.

### **Mandated R&D**

You need to make time in the team to spend 1/2 a day a week on cool stuff that might not end up with anything. No pressure, no expectation, but it must happen and can form part of their workforce development. I would say that 75% of the time this results in high value product, or part-product and really allows your team to pick off things on the "cool stuff we need to do" list, which in turn can give the business a shiny sexy thing and get them
bought into the art of the possible. The data revolution is here, and while I feel like a rogue militant saying it, you need to be equipped with the tools and skills to do well, and to do that you need to let your team develop their passions. An example of this was just today - we were reviewing content on the cloud and stumbled across a report called Mariah; turns out Ped had created a report that played audio and analysed in R the metadata from song, mariah carey songs - and played the song as linked from spotify. Pointless? No chance. R, ggplot, API and leverage custom visuals in a working model - I consider this to be nailed on value.

### **Brown bag lunches**

Or open office, or drop in sessions. Don't be sad when very few people turn up but they're pretty good ways to tackle the odd bizarre issue. What we've found is often it's the people doing manual data processing that rock up to these and usually they have an idea that could be used to improve their business area and even if it's just about raising awareness then it's gunna be useful to someone. If noone turns up? You end up eating your lunch in peace... win win. But for a no cost thing to appear more accessible it's got to be at
least a once a month thing.

### **Leadership Engagement**

I am fortunate to be surrounded by supportive leadership. My manager gives me a lot of space to operate without any problem and my AD of Technology is an absolute data supporter so we've got some voice on the leadership team, but make sure you are showing them the cool stuff you're doing. If you struggle engaging upward then engage outward; partnerships and cooperative groups are a good way to highlight value.

## Summary

The art of idea generation is by sparking some creativity within a group of people. The art of idea generation is not by demonstrating you know better, but showing the art of the possible - by showing them things can be better. You need to disrupt the organisations relationship with data as much as possible, so you need to deploy quickly, and effectively and couple that with a comprehensive campaign of positive comms at all levels of the business and to do that you need to understand your customer, you need to encourage your team and you need to identify tactical wins that sit in your business. 

Hopefully there's something in there that's at least a little helpful?
