# \#whoami

I'm a 38 year old dad of 3, I've lived in the north east all my life and my family are all local. I was never really particularly academic; I left school and went to college which was basically an excuse to get drunk, then got a job in IT when I was 19 for a small computer company called Performance Computers as an engineer. After a bunch of years there I went to work for Santander in their call centre - on the phones initially then onto a resource planning role where I always brought in a bunch of software to help planning.

I met my wife, fancied a change and applied for a job in business change. Landed it, and that was the beginning of the beginning.

Now having worked in local government for over a decade I've had the pleasure a number of different roles; business change, project managing technology deployments - I've even managed a business support team delivering blue badges which was actually really helpful grounding - it's easy for nerds to forget or disconnect from the effect of their decisions and keeping that line of sight from action to social impact is now very important to me.

I like to joke that I'm definitely not a "Bobby best practise" - I do research a lot but often stray from the common path others have tread. I'd probably like to sum myself up as a data driven disruptive technologist..., Which is a gob full but wraps up all my passions and a bit of my personality to boot. I've been fortunate enough to combine these traits in what I can only describe as a hurricane of education and experience over the past 5 years - definitely the most exciting 5 years of my career.

## More relevant stuffs

In 2010, when this journey first started - I had used crystal reports with some prebuilt sql queries that we had developed as part of a CRM implementation that had just finished in the contact centre. One of my first mistakes was bringing aforementioned CRM to a shuddering halt with a cartesian join so horrible that one of the DBA's looked at me like I'd slapped his wife. Looking back, it was pretty bad and taught me that DBA's love their work on average more than their spouses and you can't wing it on a production environment. With that I set out on a mission.

My mission began in 2010 when I went on a SQL Server 2008 r2 full stack course. I also had a daughter and got married but I still managed to spend every possible moment learning SSIS and SSAS Multi Dimensional. By 2011 I had a multi dimensional cube setup driving data from our CRM; it must have been half decent because the DBA who hadn't made eye contact with me since what we refer to now as "the day a bit of him died" peer reviewed it and didn't want to punch me in the neck. Even the supplier of the CRM hit me up for details on the build.

2012 I moved into our IT department seconded into a role to pop out a few tactical BI solutions, mostly using SSIS, SSAS and SSRS. By 2014 I'd done enough decent deployments to get a small team and by 2016 there was talk of a restructure. 2017 that happened and now through what I can only presume is a series of terrible decisions by my employers I manage a team of 30 people smashing out stuff for the whole council. And here we are - knee deep in a stew of opportunity and challenge, waking up each day with a smile on my face.

### Before you move onto reading things.

Consider all of that when you read my stuff. I'm not a pedigree data scientist with 20 years behind me, nor am I some business management doctorate with a 50 year plan and a strategy document for my strategy documents. I'm a gobby "data driven disruptive technologist" who was able to couple an understanding of what the clients needed - particularly in local government - with an ability to execute. Consider that before you listen to any of my advice, I'm just the same as anyone in your data team driven my a passion to do cool stuff.
