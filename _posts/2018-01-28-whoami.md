These about me sections really throw you, right? They all kind of read the same despite the author always struggling to sound unique (I include myself!). And with that I'm a 38 year old dad of 3, I've lived in the north east all my life and my family are all local. I was never really particularly academic; I left school and went to college which was basically an excuse to get drunk, then got a job in IT when I was 19 for a small computer company called Performance Computers as an engineer. After a bunch of years there I went to work for Santander in their call centre - on the phones initially then onto a resource planning role where I always brought in a bunch of software to help planning.

I met my wife, fancied a change and applied for a job in business change. Landed it, and that was the beginning of the beginning.

Now having worked in local government now for over a decade I've had the pleasure a number of different roles; business change, project managing technology deployments - I've even managed a business support team delivering blue badges which was actually really helpful grounding - tech nerds can easily forget about impact and seeing what the reason is you are trying tk make things better. 

I like to joke that I'm definitely not a "Bobby best practise", that but probably inaccurately still implies I'm close. What I am is a technologist and a data enthusiast, and I've been fortunate enough to combine both of these in a vacuum and experience what I can only describe as a hurricane of education over the past 5 years.

## More relevant stuffs

In 2010, when this journey first started - I had used crystal reports with some prebuilt sql queries that we had developed as part of a CRM implementation that had just finished in the contact centre. One of my first mistakes was bringing aforementioned CRM to a shuddering halt with a cartesian join so horrible that one of the DBA's looked at me like I'd slapped his wife. Looking back, it was pretty bad. I'd have upset him less with a back hand.

So in 2010 a few things happened. I went on a SQL Server 2008 r2 full stack course, I had a daughter I got married and I spent every possible moment learning SSIS and SSAS Multi Dimensional. By 2011 I had a multi dimensional cube setup driving data from our CRM; it must have been half decent because the DBA who hadn't made eye contact with me since what we refer to now as "the day a bit of him died" didn't spit at me after peer reviewing it. Even the supplier of the CRM hit me up for details on the build.

2012 I moved into IT, seconded into a role to pop out a few tactical BI solutions, mostly using SSIS, SSAS and SSRS. 2014 I'd done enough decent deployments to get a small team and by 2016 there was talk of a restructure. 2017 that happened and now through what I can only presume is a series of terrible decisions by my employers I manage a team of 30 people smashing out stuff for the whole council. And here we are - knee deep in a stew of opportunity and challenge, waking up each day with a smile on my face.

### Before you move onto reading things.

Consider all of that when you read my stuff. I'm not a pedigree data scientist with 20 years behind me, nor am I some business management doctorate with a 50 year plan and a strategy document for my strategy documents. I'm a gobby nerd who learned some stuff and was much better at shouting about how good it was than I was at actually making it. Consider that before you listen to any of my advice.
